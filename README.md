# Vulcanus Max
## Overview

This project is to create a large-format Fused Deposit Modelling (FDM) printer based on CoreXY design using the 2015 Vulcanus Max project as a starting point.

## Objectives

### Features

* Remote printing

Use OctoPrint to print over WiFi. The built-in camera lets you monitor your print. OctoPrint allows you to remotely control the printer.

* Heated Bed

The build surface can use the Monoprice 300x300 flexible build plate or borosilicate glass plate. Autoleveling makes print setup easier.

* Zoned Heated Bed

The 300x300mm heated bed has 3 zones, small, medium, or large, to reduce power consumption by only heating the portion of the bed that is needed based on the footprint of the model.

* Controller

32 bit processor running at 120MHz with 3209 stepper motor drivers and Marlin 2.0 firmware.

* Extruders

Dual Bowden tube extruders minimize print head mass for less vibration and faster print head movement.

* Vibration-free Frame

Dampers are used on all moving parts to reduce vibration.

* Ambient Temperature Management

Insulated side panels and an exhaust fan allow control of the ambient temperature inside the printer. A heater brings the enclosure quickly up to temperature before your print starts.

* Safety

High amperage power is isolated and protected so that an electrical fault will not cause a fire or damage to the controller.
